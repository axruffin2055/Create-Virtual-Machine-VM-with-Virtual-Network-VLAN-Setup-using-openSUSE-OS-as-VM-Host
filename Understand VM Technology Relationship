Understand that in the: Step-by-Step VM and Network connection creation using VM host setup give examples on most of the 
technologies I used to learn and understand how to do, create, and manage virtual machines  using these technologies differently. 
Therefore, while following the step-by-step, please understand the relationships between the VM techolongies 
because you do not need everything I show you in the step-by-step; however, I can only show you the different 
optional chooses because I want to learn and know how the create VM for different business used cases.


Below here is a relationship table; therefore you know pick this or pick that.


Group/Context               | Related Acronyms                       | Guidance
----------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------
Hypervisor Choice           | KVM OR Xen                             | Pick one based on use case:  
                            |                                        | -> KVM: Native to Linux, easier with libvirt, better GUI support  
                            |                                        | -> Xen: Type-1 hypervisor, high isolation, requires Dom0  

Virtualization Mode         | HVM  OR PV                             | Pick one based on guest OS:  
                            |                                        | -> HVM: Full virtualization for unmodified OS (e.g., Windows)  
                            |                                        | -> PV: Better performance, requires guest OS modification  

CPU Hardware Virtualization | VT-x  OR  AMD-V                        | Use whichever your CPU supports: Intel (VT-x) or AMD (AMD-V)  

Firmware / Boot Type        | BIOS   OR  UEFI (with OVMF)            | Choose based on OS support:  
                            |                                        | -> UEFI/OVMF: Required for Secure Boot, modern OSes  
                            |                                        | -> BIOS: Legacy systems only  

Xen Architecture            | Dom0 (control) + DomU (guest)          | Use if running Xen. Dom0 manages DomU VMs. Not used in KVM setups  

Networking Setup            | NAT  OR   Bridge (via nmcli)           | Pick based on access needs:  
                            |                                        | -> NAT: Easy, isolated, no LAN exposure  
                            |                                        | -> Bridge: Direct LAN access, needed for external access to VMs  

Remote Display Protocol     | VNC  OR  SPICE / virt-viewer           | Pick based on performance or client compatibility  

Device Assignment           | PCI passthrough (legacy)OR  VFIO       | VFIO is the modern, secure replacement for legacy passthrough
