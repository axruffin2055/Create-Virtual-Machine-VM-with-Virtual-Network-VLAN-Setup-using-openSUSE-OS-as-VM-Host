virt-manager and virsh are used in the same way because they both manage and configure VM and storage. However, virt-manager will allow 
you to manage and configure VM and storage using a GUI verse virsh using a CLI. 
To open Virtual Machine Manager:
virt-manager

virsh is used just like the virt-manager, but from the command line.
